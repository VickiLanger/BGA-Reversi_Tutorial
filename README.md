# BGA Reversi Tutorial

Board Game Arena (BGA) Studio is a platform to build online board game adaptations using the BGA platform.

BGA strongly suggests going through one of their tutorials before starting a new game. This repo is my attempt at following along with their [Reversi Tutorial](https://studio.boardgamearena.com/doc/Tutorial_reversi)

## Documentation
Working through this tutorial turned into a rather hefty editing of the [documentation](https://en.doc.boardgamearena.com/index.php?title=Tutorial_reversi). Hopefully, this will make it easier for others to get started in the future.
